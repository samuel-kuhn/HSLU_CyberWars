So far, an absolute masterpiece of a business song. As a wise man once said: if you want to make good music, you don’t just have to write it — you have to visualize it.

Still, I just can’t get rid of that strange whistling sound in the song. Oh well, it only bothers me on one side anyway. If anyone has the audacity to complain, i will put up fight.
